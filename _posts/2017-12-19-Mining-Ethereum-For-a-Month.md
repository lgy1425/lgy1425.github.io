title:  "Mining Ethereum For a Month"
categories: blockchain
---

I have mined Ethereum for a month with my deep learning hardwares. 6 GXT 1080 ti, 2 Tesla K80 model has been employed for mining. The GXT1080ti has a speed of 32Mhash / s and the Tesla K80 has a speed of about 10Mhash / s. When all of GPUs are employed for mining, mining speed reaches to 200Mhash/s. But I have mined Ethereum when my GPUs wasn't employed for machine learning. So, Ethereum has been mined with 100Mhash/s speed. I have mined Ethereum in MiningPoolHub(http://miningpoolhub.com/).

Until now, I have mined 0.5334 ETH and it is worth $472. If all of my GPU is employed for mining for a month and current Ethereum price is maintained, I can get about 1 ETH and it is worth $887.

Mining profit was beyond my expectation because my server room doesn't require additional electricity fee and price of Ethereum increased 3 times compared to a month ago. If GPUs' depreciation was considered, its profit will be much lower. So, buying GPUs for only mining is not profitable if price of GPUs and electricity fee and hardware maintenance cost are considered. And there is no guarantee that coins prices will continue to rise. If you already have a GPU for a different purpose (machine learning, games, etc.), it would be okay to do a little mining when not in use.
